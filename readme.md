# Sudoku Solver in Python

This is a simple Sudoku solver implemented in Python using the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular logic-based number-placement puzzle, and this program aims to solve Sudoku puzzles of varying difficulties.

### Prerequisites

Before running the Sudoku solver, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Algorithm

This Sudoku solver uses a backtracking algorithm to recursively fill in the puzzle cells while checking for validity at each step. The backtracking algorithm is an efficient way to solve Sudoku puzzles as it explores possible solutions and backtracks when it encounters contradictions.
